You are a senior embedded systems project manager. Based on the following project specification, generate a detailed list of achievable GitLab issues. Each issue should:
- Be very specific and small enough to complete in less than a day
- Clearly map to one of the projectâ€™s goals or milestones
- Include both technical (code, testing, wiring, integration) and non-technical tasks (docs, planning, setup)
- Use a short 'title' and a longer 'description'

Instructions:
- Break down each milestone into 5 to 7 concrete, small, achievable issues.
- Create issues for the entire project
- Carefully consider every milestone and goal described in the specification.
- Each issue must be distinct and actionable.
- Do not summarize the whole milestone into one issue.
- Use verbs like 'Write', 'Test', 'Wire', 'Verify', 'Install', 'Measure', 'Document'
- Avoid vague tasks like 'Set up system' or 'Plan follow mode'
- Return only a JSON array with objects containing 'title' and 'description'

Project Specification:
{spec_text}

Respond ONLY with the JSON array. Do NOT include markdown or explanations.
